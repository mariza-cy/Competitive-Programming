# The Cypriot's guide to CP

If you live in Cyprus, it's important to know how COI (Cyprus Olympiad in Informatics) works.  This is why I created this guide, which is basically a summary of the rounds, format and resources of COI.

The COI is a national competition that determines the teams that will represent Cyprus in IOI, BOI, EJOI and JBOI. It consists of 3 rounds for the selection of the IOI and BOI team and one for the selection of the EJOI and JBOI one.

For more information, you can visit the Olympiad's [official website](https://www.coinformatics.org)

## The rounds

### Round A
Usually lasting throughout the Christmas holidays (**about 2 weeks**), Round A is open for anyone interested and is held online. You need to sign up in advance (you can find the form in the homepage of the website), and you can take part in the [CMS platform](https://cmscoinformatics.org/). There is no timer, so no matter the time you first enter the platform, you can submit until the contests ends. The competition consists of **4 problems**, and you can earn **up to 100 points from each one**. To advance to the next round, you need to get **at least 200 points**, regardless of the other participants' scores.

### Round B
Held onsite, usually during March, the second round consists of **3 problems (so you can earn up to 300 points)** and lasts **4 hours**. The **first 16 participants** advance to Round C, and up to 20 are invited at the preperation camp. The problems are harder than Round A, requiring more knowledge and algorithms and generally closer to the level of IOI (but still quite lower).

### EJOI
The junior round is independed from the other rounds and will determine the **4 students that will represent Cyprus in EJOI and JBOI**. Like Round B it's held onsite, lasts **4 hous** and consists of **4 problems**. It's usually held on April.

### Round C
The 3<sup>rd</sup> and final round is held on **2 days**, usually a week apart, each **5 hours** long and consisting of **3 problems**. The results determine the **4 students that will represent Cyprus in IOI and BOI (the teams might be different beacuse of the BOI age limits)**.
