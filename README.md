# Getting started

First of all, welcome! This repository consists of a set of courses designed to teach you everything you need to know in order to attend competitive programming competitions, regardless of your programming experience.
The lessons are short and simple, with links to excercises on other websites to practice. In the end of each unit you will find a cheatsheet, everything you learned in that unit in a printable file.

## The courses
If you're not sure which course you should start from, here is an overview of each of them:

### C++

#### [A1. The cin course]()
If you don't have any programming experience, start from here. This course will teach you the basics of programming and writing in C++, with some extra details that will be useful in CP problems.

#### [A2. The return course]()
If you have programing experience in any language, you might prefer to start with a short course on syntax and no introdustory "What is programmin?" courses. The excercises are more interesting and require some problem solving, so you can learn how to use everything you know in CP, as well.

### Competitive programming

#### [B1. The #define course]()
Even if you have some coding experience, CP (which is short for Competitive Programming) is quite a unique field. In this course you will learn everything you need to know about CP, like competitions you can take part in, useful websites etc.
